Step 1 : Create a file using File.Create() Method and Enter some data inside the File in the format of 
		 Student Name,Class Room Number.

Step 2  : Create a List Which Stores the Data of student. By using File.ReadLines() Method and a Extension method 
		  called ORDERBY we store the data inside the List named Details.

Step 3 :  Create a Write method to write the data in the file. for that we need to create a File Stream Object and pass Appropiate parameters
		  With FileMode OPEN and FileAccess Write.
		  
		  And Create a Stream Writter Class object then pass the FileSteam Object as the parameter.

		  Then create a do While Loop and ask the user to enter Student Name and Class Room of that student.When user giveS "NO"
		  the code Exit from the inner loop.

Ster 4 :  Create a another method called Read() to read the data from the file which is already there.
		  for reading the data from the file we need to create StreamWritter Class and to the reading Operations.

Step 5 :  Create a sort method for sorting the data inside the Details List Which we created in the Step 2. By using the default sort method and
		  with the help of lambda function sort the list with respect to name of the students in Alphabetical order.

Step 6 :  Create a method for searching the data in the list Entered by the user. it asks user to enter the name of the student 
		  and find wheather the student is present in the list or not if the student is present inside the list it print the entire data of 
		  the student and print student not found if the student isn't in the list.

Step 7:  Finally Create a Switch Statement to give the choice upto user which method he/she wants to run.
